- Adaption to fire and response after fire.
- Role of groundwater access? Correlate GRACE with lagged PPT.
- Plot rooting depth?
- Something about leaf angle (pendulous Eucs).
- Annually shedding a layer of dead bark: smooth bark performs photosynthetic refixation, reducing respiratory carbon losses from wood, and increasing the carbon use efficiency and by consequence the water use efficiency at the whole plant level - Cernusak papers.
- is light saturation point for photosynthesis higher than other trees? Use eqn from C3 Niinemets and Tenhunen (1997).
- Can we also look at fluxnet datasets:
    - Y_flux = gammaTair * XTair + gammaPrecip * XPrecip + residual error
    - Need to detrend, work on anomalies
    - gammaTair + gammaPrecip are the flux sensitivites to (monthly? seasonal? annual?) variations to temperature (g C m-2 y-1 per degC) and precipitation (g C m-2 y-1 per mm timestep-1), respectively.
- LMA (or SLA) ... vs Narea.
- What else is in TRY? bark thickness?
- More p50 data - Li et al. paper
- Responses to extremes ...
- Calculate flux sensitivity to delta Tair.
- Is R25/Vcmax25 higher in Eucs where soil nutrients are lower?
- Anything seasonally on g1/Vcmax?
