- Physiology datasets: A-Ci curves (Vcmax, Jmax), respiration, and stomatal conductance (g1-ci/ca).
- Traits: SLA, leaf N, P, wood density, bark thickness, leaf lifespan, hydraulic traits (e.g. P50)
- What is in TRY?
- Structural datasets: tree height, allometry, biomass data, leaf size, shape, angle, rooting depth.
- Data from manipulation experiments: do we have the right processes in response to extremes e.g. drought tolerance/heatwaves.
- Adaption to fire and response after fire.
- Role of groundwater access?
